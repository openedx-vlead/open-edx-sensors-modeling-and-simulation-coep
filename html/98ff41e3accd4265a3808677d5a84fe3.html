When the simulator window opens, initial pH value is displayed in the control panel on the screen. Select the pH value for which the probe is to be calibrated.<br /> 2. After entering pH value the pH verses output mV values are displayed.<br /> 3. Click on 'Plot'. The graph of pH verses millivolt will be displayed.<br /> 4. After getting the graph, hide the graph and switch on to the next experiment i.e. Level 2<br /> <br /> <b>Level 2: Measurement of pH</b><br /> <b>Aim: Study of Measurement of pH.</b> <br /> In this experiment, by using the <b>formula</b> one can calculate the pH and understand the pH measurement system.<br /> <b>Step by step Procedure:</b><br /> 1. Study the measurement diagram completely.<br /> 2. Select the sample. After selecting the sample, pH value will be displayed on the screen.<br /> 3. Enter the calculated millivolt value. For calculations of millivolt click on <b>FORMULA</b> tab.<br /> 4. Using the formula, calculate the value of the millivolt output for the sample. In the formula, value of pHc is the pH value deviated from 7. Subtract the value of pH from 7 and enter the answer in the box provided (upto 2 decimals with rounding off). Submit the answer using submit button.<br /> 5. If your calculation is correct, the output millivolt value will be displayed on the screen.<br /> 6. Repeat the procedure if necessary for different samples <br /><br /> <b>Level 3: Effect of Temperature</b> <br /> <b>Aim: Study the effect of temperature change on measurement of pH.</b> <br /> <b>Step by step Procedure:</b><br /> 1. In this level the sample is the same as selected in level 2. This is default selection. The pH of the sample is displayed in the control panel.<br /> 2. Click on Get Temperature. The temperature of sample and the output milli volt will be displayed on the screen now. Compare this value with the pervious level output value. The reference temperature considered for the previous levels is 25oC. <br /> 3. Click on <b>Plot</b> tab to plot the graph. <br /> You can verify the answer by putting the values in a <b>formula</b>. Only value of the temperature (in Kelvin) will change.<br /> After completion of all the parts, you can proceed to Post Test to find out if you have understood all aspects of the experiment.<br /> <br /><br /> <font color="red"><b><u>Conductivity Measurement</u></b></font><br /> <br /> <b>Level 1: Conductivity Measurement</b> <br /> <b>Aim: To study the measurement of the conductivity of the sample.</b><br /> <b>Step by step Procedure:</b> <br /> 1. Study the schematic diagram. <br /> 2. Select the sample from drop down menu. <br /> 3. Select the concentration of the sample. <br /> 4. Cell constant will be fixed which is displayed as 1 on screen.<br /> 5. After entering data the PPM Concentration, Equivalent weight and Density at 25 ËšC is displayed in the right side panel.<br /> 6. Enter the calculated specific conductance. For calculations of specific conductance click on <b>Formula</b> tab. <br /> Using the formula, calculate the value of the conductivity for the selected sample and enter the answer in the box provided (upto 2 decimals with rounding off). Submit the answer using submit button. <br /> 8. If your calculation is correct it will be displayed on the screen. Otherwise you need to recalculate. <br /> 9. Repeat the procedure for different concentrations of a same sample.<br /> 10. Minimum three calculations are necessary to plot the graph and after three calculations the <b>plot</b> tab will be activated.<br /> 11. H Click on <b>plot</b> tab and observe the graph. Hide the graph and repeat the experiment with varying samples if necessary with Next set of values tab. <br /> 12. Observe the graph and switch to the next level with Level 2 tab. <br /> <br /> <b>Level 2: Effect of Temperature.</b> <br /> <b>Aim: Study the effect of temperature change on the measurement of conductivity.</b> <br /> In this experiment, by using the formula one can change the value of the temperature and calculate the conductivity.<br /> <b>Step by step Procedure:</b><br /> 1. Study the schematic diagram.<br /> 2. The sample selected is by default the user has selected for level 1.<br /> 3. Select the concentration of the substance. Selected concentration will be displayed on the screen.<br /> 4. Click on <b>Get Temp</b> . The temperature value and its temperature coefficient will be displayed on the right hand side on the screen.<br /> 5. Enter the calculated conductivity at a temperature of interest. For calculations of conductivity click on <b>FORMULA</b> tab. Using formula, calculate the value of the conductivity for the selected sample and enter the answer in the box provided (upto 2 decimals with rounding off). Submit the answer using submit button.<br /> 6. If your calculation is correct, the output conductivity at the selected temperature will be displayed on the screen.<br /> 8. Repeat the procedure for different temperatures of the same substance and concentration.<br /> 9. Minimum three calculations are necessary to plot the graph and after three calculations the <b>plot</b> tab will be activated.<br /> 10. After study hide the graph and repeat the experiment with varying substance and concentration.<br /> 11. Observe the graph and switch to the next experiment<br /><br /> <b>Level 3: Effect of Contamination</b><br /> <b>Aim: Study the effect of contamination on measurement of pH.</b> <br /> In this experiment, one can change the value of the contamination and observe its effect on the conductivity of the substance.<br /> <b>Step by step Procedure:</b><br /> 1. Study the diagram completely.<br /> 2. Select the substance .Selected substance will be displayed on the screen.<br /> 3. Select the concentration of the substance. Selected concentration will be displayed on the screen.<br /> 4. Cell constant will be fixed which is displayed as 1 on screen.<br /> 5. Select the contamination in mm.<br /> 6. After selecting the contamination the Specific conductance, Modified Cell Constant ,Modified specific conductance value is displayed on the screen.<br /> 7. By comparing the Specific conductance, Modified specific conductance one can see the effect of contamination on substance conductivity.<br /> 8.
